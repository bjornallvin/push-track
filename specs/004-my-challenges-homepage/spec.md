# Feature Specification: Quick Challenge Access

**Feature Branch**: `004-my-challenges-homepage`
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Show a link/button to my current challenge on the start page. Load current challenges from local storage. Save challenge to localStorage when visiting it so that we can quickly get back to it from the start page later"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-24

- Q: What should happen when a saved challenge ID is invalid or no longer exists? → A: Silently remove invalid entries from localStorage and don't display them
- Q: What should happen when localStorage contains corrupted or unparseable data? → A: Clear all corrupted data and start fresh (empty state)
- Q: How should very long activity names or challenge display text be displayed in the quick access section? → A: Truncate with ellipsis after a character limit
- Q: What structure should be used to store challenge data in localStorage? → A: Single JSON array with all challenges stored under one key
- Q: Should challenge metadata (especially activity names) be sanitized before display to prevent potential security issues? → A: Sanitize and escape all challenge metadata before display to prevent XSS
- Q: Do challenges have names/titles in the data model? → A: No, challenges have ID, activities array, duration, and start date - display format is "Your {duration}-Day Challenge" with activities listed

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Return to Active Challenge (Priority: P1)

A user visits their challenge page, then later returns to the homepage and wants to quickly access their active challenge without searching for the link or checking email.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - reducing friction for users to return to their active challenges. This solves the primary pain point of having to find the challenge URL each time.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting a challenge page, navigating to the homepage, and verifying a quick access link appears that navigates back to the challenge. Delivers immediate value as a standalone feature.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has never visited any challenge, **When** they view the homepage, **Then** no quick access link is displayed
2. **Given** a user visits a challenge page at `/challenge/abc123`, **When** they navigate to the homepage, **Then** a quick access button/link for challenge `abc123` appears on the homepage
3. **Given** a user has a saved challenge in localStorage, **When** they click the quick access link, **Then** they are navigated to their challenge page
4. **Given** a user has visited multiple challenges, **When** they view the homepage, **Then** they see a link to their most recently visited challenge

### User Story 2 - Multiple Recent Challenges (Priority: P2)

A user manages multiple challenges simultaneously (e.g., different exercise types or timeframes) and wants to see all their recent challenges on the homepage for easy access.

**Why this priority**: Enhances the core feature by supporting users with multiple active challenges. This is valuable but not essential for the MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by visiting multiple challenge pages, returning to the homepage, and verifying all recent challenges appear as quick access links.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits challenges A, B, and C in sequence, **When** they view the homepage, **Then** all three challenges appear in the quick access section, ordered by most recent first
2. **Given** a user has 5+ saved challenges, **When** they view the homepage, **Then** all challenges are displayed, ordered by most recent first
3. **Given** a user clicks on one challenge from the list, **When** they return to the homepage, **Then** that challenge moves to the top of the recent list

---

### User Story 3 - Challenge Removal from Recent List (Priority: P3)

A user has completed or abandoned a challenge and wants to remove it from their recent challenges list to keep the homepage clean.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have feature for users who want to manage their quick access list. Not critical for initial launch but improves long-term usability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by displaying recent challenges with a remove/dismiss option and verifying the challenge is removed from the list when dismissed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has recent challenges displayed, **When** they click a "remove" or "dismiss" action on a challenge, **Then** that challenge is removed from the recent list
2. **Given** a user removes all challenges from their recent list, **When** they view the homepage, **Then** the quick access section is hidden or shows an empty state
3. **Given** a user removes a challenge and then visits it again, **When** they return to the homepage, **Then** the challenge reappears in the recent list

---

### Edge Cases

- Invalid or deleted challenges are silently removed from localStorage and not displayed to users
- Corrupted or malformed localStorage data is cleared entirely, resetting the feature to an empty state
- localStorage disabled or unavailable: feature is hidden with no errors shown (per FR-006)
- Very long activity names or challenge display text are truncated with ellipsis to fit the UI layout
- Cross-device access: challenges visited on one device will not appear on another device (localStorage is device-specific, per assumptions)
- Challenge metadata (especially activity names) are sanitized and escaped before display to prevent XSS attacks

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST save the challenge ID to browser localStorage when a user visits any challenge page
- **FR-002**: System MUST save the challenge metadata (activities array, duration, start date) along with the ID for display purposes
- **FR-003**: System MUST save a timestamp of when the challenge was last visited
- **FR-004**: Homepage MUST load and display saved challenges from localStorage on page load
- **FR-005**: Quick access links MUST navigate users directly to their saved challenge pages
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle localStorage being unavailable gracefully (feature hidden, no errors shown)
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate challenge IDs from localStorage before displaying them; invalid or non-existent challenges MUST be silently removed from localStorage
- **FR-008**: System MUST order recent challenges by most recently visited first
- **FR-009**: Quick access section MUST be hidden when no challenges are saved in localStorage
- **FR-010**: System MUST clear all localStorage data for this feature when corrupted or unparseable data is encountered and start with an empty state
- **FR-011**: System MUST truncate activity names or challenge display text that exceeds the display width limit, showing ellipsis (...) to indicate truncation
- **FR-012**: System MUST sanitize and escape all challenge metadata (especially activity names) before display to prevent XSS attacks

### Assumptions

- Users primarily access challenges from a single device/browser (localStorage is not synced across devices)
- Challenge IDs remain stable and do not change over time
- Users will accept that clearing browser data removes their recent challenges list
- The feature will use standard browser localStorage with a reasonable size limit (typically 5-10MB)
- Challenge display text (duration, activities) fit within typical UI constraints (truncate if necessary)

### Key Entities

- **Recent Challenge Entry**: Represents a saved challenge in localStorage with properties: challenge ID, activities array (e.g., ["Push-ups", "Pull-ups"]), duration (number of days), start date, last visited timestamp, challenge URL
- **localStorage Structure**: Single JSON array stored under one key containing all recent challenge entries, allowing efficient retrieval and updates

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can access their most recent challenge from the homepage in 2 clicks or less (1 click on the quick access link)
- **SC-002**: The quick access section loads and displays within 100ms of homepage load (localStorage read is instant)
- **SC-003**: 90% of users who visit a challenge page successfully see the quick access link on their next homepage visit
- **SC-004**: Users with saved challenges spend 50% less time navigating to their challenge pages compared to finding links manually
- **SC-005**: Zero JavaScript errors occur when localStorage is disabled or unavailable
