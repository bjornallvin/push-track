# Implementation Plan: Quick Challenge Access

**Branch**: `004-my-challenges-homepage` | **Date**: 2025-10-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-my-challenges-homepage/spec.md`

## Summary

Implement a localStorage-based quick access feature on the homepage that displays recently visited challenges. When users visit a challenge page, the system automatically saves challenge metadata (ID, activities, duration, start date) to browser localStorage. The homepage displays all saved challenges in a clean, mobile-first UI with truncation for long text and XSS protection. Invalid or deleted challenges are silently removed. This feature reduces friction for returning users by providing 1-click access to active challenges without requiring email lookups or URL bookmarking.

**Technical Approach**: Client-side React component with localStorage persistence, following existing patterns from theme-toggle.tsx. Server-side validation of challenge IDs via existing API endpoints. No new backend infrastructure required.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.4.0 with Next.js 14.2.0 (App Router) + React 18.3.1
**Primary Dependencies**: react-hook-form (7.65.0), zod (3.25.76), shadcn/ui components, tailwindcss (3.4.0), lucide-react (0.378.0)
**Storage**: Browser localStorage (client-side only) - no server-side storage for this feature
**Testing**: Manual testing on mobile viewport (320px, 375px) + TypeScript type checking via `npm run lint`
**Target Platform**: Web (mobile-first: iOS Safari 15+, Chrome Android 100+; desktop: Chrome 100+, Safari 15+, Firefox 100+)
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js App Router with Server + Client Components)
**Performance Goals**:
- localStorage read/write < 10ms (instant)
- Homepage render with saved challenges < 100ms
- Initial page load < 2s on 3G
**Constraints**:
- localStorage max ~5MB (adequate for hundreds of challenges)
- Client-side only (no cross-device sync)
- Must handle localStorage unavailable/disabled gracefully
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Responsive breakpoints: 320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px
**Scale/Scope**:
- Expected 1-10 saved challenges per user
- JSON array storage with challenge metadata
- Feature limited to homepage UI component + localStorage utility module

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### ✅ I. Mobile-First Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Touch targets: Quick access links/buttons will be ≥44x44px
- Responsive: Component designed for 320px minimum width first
- Testing: Mobile viewport (320px, 375px) tested before desktop
- Single-handed use: Quick access section positioned in thumb-reachable zone

**Status**: PASS - Feature is mobile-first by design

### ✅ II. Simplicity Over Features
- No speculative features: Only P1 (single challenge access) required for MVP
- Standard solutions: Using browser localStorage API (no external libs)
- Validated user problem: Reduces friction for returning to active challenges
- Complexity justified: Minimal - client-side component + localStorage utility

**Status**: PASS - Minimal, focused implementation

### ✅ III. Type Safety & Validation
- Zod schemas: Challenge metadata validated before localStorage write
- TypeScript strict mode: All types defined for localStorage data structures
- Data boundaries: Challenge data from API validated, localStorage data validated on read
- No `any` types: Full type safety maintained

**Status**: PASS - Type-safe implementation planned

### ✅ IV. Progressive Enhancement
- Server Components: Homepage is Server Component by default
- Client Components: Only quick access section needs `'use client'` (for localStorage)
- Core functionality: Homepage works without JS (quick access gracefully hidden)
- No critical path: Feature is enhancement, not blocking core flows

**Status**: PASS - Quick access is progressive enhancement

### ✅ V. Observability Through Simplicity
- Error messages: Console warnings for corrupted data (no user-facing errors)
- Shallow hierarchy: RecentChallenges component → ChallengeLink subcomponent (2 levels max)
- Clear logging: localStorage operations logged for debugging
- Simple abstraction: Utility module wraps localStorage with error handling

**Status**: PASS - Simple, observable implementation

### ✅ VI. UI-First Development
- UI prototype: Build functional quick access section with static mock data first
- Interactive prototype: Clickable challenge links, remove buttons, empty states
- Design validation: Verify responsive behavior, truncation, gradients on mobile
- Backend integration: After prototype approval, integrate localStorage + validation

**Status**: PASS - UI-first workflow planned

### Quality Standards Compliance

**Performance Targets**:
- ✅ Initial page load < 2s: Quick access adds <10ms (localStorage read)
- ✅ Time to Interactive < 3s: Client component hydration minimal overhead
- ✅ No API calls: Pure client-side feature, no server latency

**Accessibility**:
- ✅ Touch targets: 44x44px minimum for challenge links
- ✅ Semantic HTML: `<nav>` for quick access section, `<a>` links
- ✅ Color contrast: Follow existing homepage gradient patterns (4.5:1 ratio)
- ✅ Focus indicators: shadcn/ui buttons include focus styles

**Browser Support**:
- ✅ Mobile: iOS Safari 15+, Chrome Android 100+ (localStorage fully supported)
- ✅ Desktop: Chrome 100+, Safari 15+, Firefox 100+ (localStorage universal)
- ✅ Responsive: 320px minimum width tested

```

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure (Next.js App Router). Feature adds:
- 1 new client component (`components/recent-challenges.tsx`)
- 1 new utility module (`lib/localStorage/recent-challenges.ts`)
- Minor modifications to existing `app/page.tsx` and `app/challenge/[id]/page.tsx`

No new API routes or server-side logic required. Feature is entirely client-side.
