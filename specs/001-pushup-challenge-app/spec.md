# Feature Specification: Pushup Challenge Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `001-pushup-challenge-app`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A pushup challenge app. I want to build a simple pushup challenge app. Stack: NextJS, Tailwind, shadcn, Vercel, Redis storage, Typescript. Features: 1. Start a challenge (length & goal), 2. Enter todays pushups (one time per day). 3. Se chart of progress. Ask me more to clarify."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18

- Q: Should the app require users to set a daily pushup goal target? → A: No daily goal in numbers. Just track how many pushups users can make each day.
- Q: What is the primary device/platform target? → A: Mobile first design.
- Q: What key statistics should be prominently displayed to users? → A: Current day, streak (consecutive days logged), personal best
- Q: Which chart type should be used for progress visualization on mobile? → A: Vertical bar chart (one bar per day)
- Q: What input method should be used for logging daily pushup counts? → A: Default to yesterday's number, then plus/minus buttons and a submit button
- Q: Should logging zero pushups count as maintaining the streak? → A: Zero breaks streak (only non-zero counts maintain it)
- Q: What information should be shown in the completion summary? → A: Total pushups, completion rate %, best day, final streak

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Start Challenge (Priority: P1)

A user wants to commit to a daily pushup habit by setting up a challenge with a specific duration to track their performance over time.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational entry point for the entire application. Without the ability to create a challenge, no other features can function. It represents the minimum viable product that delivers immediate value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a challenge with a duration, then verifying the challenge is saved and accessible. Delivers the core value of committing to a structured daily habit.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a new user opening the app, **When** I choose to start a new challenge, **Then** I should be prompted to enter challenge duration
2. **Given** I am creating a challenge, **When** I specify a duration (in days), **Then** the system should save my challenge and mark today as day 1
3. **Given** I have entered invalid challenge parameters (e.g., negative numbers, zero duration), **When** I attempt to create the challenge, **Then** I should see clear error messages explaining what needs to be corrected
4. **Given** I have successfully created a challenge, **When** I view the challenge dashboard, **Then** I should see my duration, current day, and progress status

### User Story 2 - Log Daily Pushups (Priority: P2)

A user wants to record their daily pushup count to track progress toward their goal and maintain accountability.

**Why this priority**: This is the core engagement loop that drives user retention and goal achievement. Without daily logging, users cannot track progress, making the challenge meaningless.

**Independent Test**: Can be independently tested by creating a challenge (P1 prerequisite) and then logging pushups for a day. Delivers the value of tracking daily performance and accountability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have an active challenge and have not logged pushups today, **When** I navigate to the app, **Then** I should see a clear prompt to log today's pushups with the input pre-filled to yesterday's count
2. **Given** I am logging my pushups for today, **When** I use plus/minus buttons to adjust the count and tap submit, **Then** the system should record this count for today's date
3. **Given** I have already logged pushups today, **When** I try to log again on the same day, **Then** the system should prevent duplicate entries and show my already-logged count
4. **Given** I miss a day without logging, **When** I open the app the next day, **Then** I should see which days I missed (but cannot retroactively log for past days)
5. **Given** I am on day 1 of my challenge, **When** I open the app to log pushups, **Then** the input should default to 0 (no previous day exists)
6. **Given** I am adjusting the count using plus/minus buttons, **When** I interact with them on mobile, **Then** the buttons should be large enough for easy tapping (minimum 44x44 pixels)

---

### User Story 3 - View Progress Chart (Priority: P3)

A user wants to visualize their pushup progress over time to stay motivated and identify patterns or improvements.

**Why this priority**: Visual feedback significantly increases motivation and provides insights into performance trends. While important for engagement, the app can function without it (users could still create challenges and log progress).

**Independent Test**: Can be independently tested by creating a challenge (P1), logging multiple days of pushups (P2), and then viewing the chart. Delivers the value of visual motivation and progress insights.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have logged pushups for multiple days, **When** I view the progress chart, **Then** I should see a vertical bar chart with one bar per day showing my daily pushup counts
2. **Given** I am viewing the progress chart, **When** I look at the visualization, **Then** I should be able to see trends and patterns in my performance over time
3. **Given** I have completed some days and missed others, **When** I view the chart, **Then** missed days should be visually distinct as gaps or empty bars
4. **Given** I am on day 1 of my challenge, **When** I view the progress chart, **Then** I should see at least today's data point (or a helpful message if I haven't logged yet)
5. **Given** I am viewing the chart on mobile, **When** I interact with the bars, **Then** each bar should be touch-friendly and clearly display the exact count for that day

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user completes their challenge duration? System displays a completion summary/celebration screen showing: total pushups, completion rate percentage, best day (highest count), and final streak. User can then start a new challenge (previous challenge data is not retained).
- What happens when a user doesn't log for multiple consecutive days? Missed days are tracked and visible in the progress view, but system continues to allow logging for current day. Challenge remains active until duration ends.
- What happens if a user tries to create a new challenge while already having an active challenge? System prompts user to either continue current challenge or abandon it to start a new one. Only one active challenge permitted at a time.
- How does the system handle timezone differences (user traveling or changing timezone)? Day boundaries are determined by browser's local timezone at time of logging. If user changes timezone, the current calendar date in new timezone determines whether they can log.
- What happens when a user logs zero pushups for a day? Zero is a valid entry - user can explicitly log zero pushups if they attempted but couldn't complete any. However, logging zero breaks the streak (streak resets to 0).
- How does the app handle users who want to change their challenge duration mid-challenge? Duration is locked once a challenge starts to maintain commitment integrity. Users must abandon current challenge and create a new one to change duration.

### Key Entities

- **Challenge**: Represents a user's commitment to daily pushup tracking over a specified period. Attributes include: total duration (number of days), start date, current status (active/completed)
- **Daily Log Entry**: Represents a single day's pushup count. Attributes include: date, pushup count, relationship to the challenge
- **Progress Metrics**: Calculated values showing performance including: current day number, streak (consecutive days with logged entries), personal best (highest single-day count), days logged vs. days missed, total pushups completed

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can create a new challenge with clear, intuitive inputs on mobile
- **SC-002**: Users can easily log their daily pushups from opening the app on mobile
- **SC-003**: Users successfully create their first challenge without encountering errors
- **SC-004**: Users can view their complete progress history for the current challenge at any time
- **SC-005**: The system correctly prevents duplicate entries when users attempt to log multiple times per day
- **SC-006**: Visual chart clearly distinguishes between logged days and missed days at a glance on mobile screens
- **SC-007**: All interactive elements meet minimum touch target size of 44x44 pixels for mobile usability

## Assumptions

- Users are self-motivated and will honestly log their pushup counts (no verification mechanism)
- Users operate in a single timezone for the duration of their challenge
- A "day" is defined by calendar date in the user's local timezone
- Users can only have one active challenge at a time (simplifies initial implementation)
- Challenge duration is measured in days, not weeks or months
- Reasonable limits: challenge duration between 1-365 days, daily pushup count between 0-10000
- The app is designed for individual use, not team/group challenges
- Users access the app primarily via mobile web browsers (mobile-first design with desktop as secondary)
- No user authentication required for MVP (URL-based challenge access)
- Data persistence should survive browser refreshes and return visits
- The focus is on habit formation (daily logging) rather than achieving specific performance targets
