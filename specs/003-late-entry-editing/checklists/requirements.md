# Specification Quality Checklist: Late Entry Editing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All items validated successfully

### Content Quality Assessment
- Specification focuses on what users need (edit past day data) and why (maintain accurate logs, correct mistakes)
- No technology-specific details mentioned (React, TypeScript, Redis implementation details excluded)
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- No clarification markers present - all requirements are specific and actionable
- Each functional requirement can be tested (e.g., FR-001 can be verified by attempting to edit any past day)
- Success criteria are quantitative (e.g., "under 30 seconds", "100% of valid operations", "within 1 second")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "chart updates immediately" vs. "React state updates trigger re-render")
- Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format with clear conditions and outcomes
- Edge cases cover validation, boundary conditions, error handling, and authorization concerns
- Scope is bounded to editing past days within the challenge period (excludes future days)
- Assumptions section documents dependencies on existing systems and UX decisions deferred to planning

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- P1 story covers core functionality (edit any past day), independently testable
- P2 story adds value (visual distinction) without blocking P1
- P3 story optimizes UX (bulk edit) but isn't required for MVP
- Each priority can be implemented, tested, and deployed independently
- Success criteria can be verified without knowing implementation (e.g., timing measurements, persistence tests)

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.
