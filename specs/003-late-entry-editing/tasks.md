# Tasks: Late Entry Editing

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-late-entry-editing/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/log-api.md

**Tests**: Manual testing only (per constitution). No automated test tasks included.

**Organization**: Tasks organized by implementation phases, following UI-first development (Constitution Principle VI).

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Next.js 14 App Router: `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` at repository root
- Server components in `app/`, client components in `components/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and validation

- [ ] T001 Validate existing project structure matches plan.md requirements
- [ ] T002 [P] Verify lucide-react icons are available (Edit2 icon needed)
- [ ] T003 [P] Verify date-fns is available for date manipulation

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core validation and type extensions that ALL user story tasks depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 Extend LogEntry type in lib/challenge/types.ts to add LogRepsRequest interface with optional date field
- [ ] T005 Extend Zod validation schema in lib/challenge/validation.ts to add optional date field with future-date validation
- [ ] T006 Add ChallengeDay interface in lib/challenge/types.ts for edit button logic (derived entity, no storage)

**Checkpoint**: Type definitions and validation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Edit Previous Day Entry (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to add or update activity data for past days from the progress page, maintaining an accurate challenge log

**Independent Test**: Navigate to progress page ‚Üí click edit button for any past day ‚Üí enter/update activity values ‚Üí save ‚Üí verify data persists and chart updates correctly

### UI Prototype First (Constitution Principle VI)

**Static UI with mock data - build these BEFORE backend integration**

- [ ] T007 [P] [US1] Create EditDayButton component in components/challenge/edit-day-button.tsx with static link and 44x44px touch target
- [ ] T008 [US1] Add EditDayButton rendering logic to ProgressChart component in components/challenge/progress-chart.tsx with mock date array (10 days)
- [ ] T009 [US1] Create edit page at app/challenge/[id]/edit/page.tsx with mock challenge data and ActivityLogger integration
- [ ] T010 [US1] Extend ActivityLogger component in components/challenge/activity-logger.tsx to accept targetDate and existingLogs props for pre-filling

**Checkpoint**: Functional UI prototype with static data - ready for stakeholder demo and approval

### Backend Integration

**Connect UI to real API and data**

- [ ] T011 [US1] Update repository.logReps method in lib/challenge/repository.ts to accept optional targetDate parameter
- [ ] T012 [US1] Extend API route in app/api/challenge/[id]/log/route.ts to parse optional date parameter and validate date range
- [ ] T013 [US1] Update API route to skip duplicate-check and completion-check when in edit mode (date parameter present)
- [ ] T014 [US1] Update ActivityLogger submit handler in components/challenge/activity-logger.tsx to include date in API request when targetDate provided
- [ ] T015 [US1] Replace mock data in edit page app/challenge/[id]/edit/page.tsx with real challenge and log fetching
- [ ] T016 [US1] Update ProgressChart in components/challenge/progress-chart.tsx to derive real dates from challenge and render edit buttons with isEditable logic

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 is fully functional - users can edit any past day's data and see chart updates

---

## Phase 4: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final refinements across all components

- [ ] T017 [P] Verify accessibility: aria-labels on edit buttons, keyboard navigation, focus indicators
- [ ] T018 [P] Verify mobile touch targets meet 44x44px minimum (use browser inspector at 320px, 375px viewports)
- [ ] T019 Verify API response time < 500ms for edit operations (use Network tab)
- [ ] T020 Verify chart updates immediately after save without page reload
- [ ] T021 Run manual test scenarios from specs/003-late-entry-editing/quickstart.md Phase 3 checklist
- [ ] T022 Final constitution compliance check against all 6 principles

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user story work
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
  - UI Prototype section must complete BEFORE Backend Integration section (Constitution Principle VI)
  - Within UI Prototype: T007 must complete before T008 (component needed for rendering)
  - Within Backend Integration: Sequential execution recommended (each task modifies existing code)
- **Polish (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Only user story for this feature - no inter-story dependencies

### Within User Story 1

**UI Prototype Section**:
- T007 (EditDayButton component) can start after Phase 2
- T008 (Add to ProgressChart) depends on T007 completing
- T009 (Edit page) and T010 (ActivityLogger extension) can run in parallel after T007

**Backend Integration Section** (after UI approval):
- T011 (Repository) and T012 (API route core) can run in parallel
- T013 (API route edit mode logic) depends on T012
- T014 (ActivityLogger API call) depends on T010, T012, T013
- T015 (Edit page real data) depends on T009, T011
- T016 (ProgressChart real dates) depends on T008, T011

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: T002 and T003 can run in parallel (dependency verification)
- **Phase 3 UI Prototype**: T009 and T010 can run in parallel (different components)
- **Phase 3 Backend**: T011 and T012 can run in parallel (different layers)
- **Phase 4**: T017, T018, T019, T020 can run in parallel (different verification aspects)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

### UI Prototype Phase
```bash
# After T007 completes, launch these together:
Task: "Create edit page at app/challenge/[id]/edit/page.tsx"
Task: "Extend ActivityLogger component in components/challenge/activity-logger.tsx"
```

### Backend Integration Phase
```bash
# After Phase 2 completes, launch these together:
Task: "Update repository.logReps method in lib/challenge/repository.ts"
Task: "Extend API route in app/api/challenge/[id]/log/route.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

This feature consists of a single user story, so MVP = full feature:

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (~15 minutes)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (~30 minutes)
3. Complete Phase 3 UI Prototype section (~2-3 hours)
4. **STOP for DEMO**: Get stakeholder approval on UI prototype
5. Complete Phase 3 Backend Integration section (~3-4 hours)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all acceptance scenarios from spec.md
7. Complete Phase 4: Polish (~30 minutes)
8. Final validation and ready for PR

**Total Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours (per quickstart.md)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Type system ready (30 min)
2. UI Prototype ‚Üí Interactive mockup demo ready (3 hours)
3. Backend Integration ‚Üí Full feature functional (7 hours cumulative)
4. Polish ‚Üí Production ready (8 hours cumulative)

---

## Acceptance Criteria (from spec.md)

Feature complete when all 5 acceptance scenarios pass:

1. ‚úÖ Click edit button on missed day ‚Üí see form for that date
2. ‚úÖ Enter valid activity values on missed day ‚Üí chart bar changes from red to colored
3. ‚úÖ Click edit button on logged day ‚Üí see existing values pre-filled
4. ‚úÖ Update existing day's values ‚Üí chart reflects new values
5. ‚úÖ Cancel edit without saving ‚Üí no changes made

Additional validation:

6. ‚úÖ SC-001: Users can edit past day in < 30 seconds
7. ‚úÖ SC-002: Chart updates without page refresh
8. ‚úÖ SC-003: 100% of edits persist and survive reload
9. ‚úÖ SC-004: Future dates cannot be edited (button hidden)
10. ‚úÖ SC-005: Error feedback shown within 1 second

- [US1] label = User Story 1 task (only user story in this feature)
- UI-first approach: Build prototype with mock data before backend integration
- Constitution Principle VI compliance: Prototype ‚Üí Demo ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Polish
- All edit buttons must meet 44x44px minimum touch target (FR-003)
- Date format: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) throughout
- Backward compatibility: Existing log functionality unchanged (date parameter optional)
- No test automation: Manual testing per constitution
- Commit after each completed task or logical group
